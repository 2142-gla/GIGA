# 'main' code block

# Load the gdl file and create the gml file

# Iterate through the gdl file

# Build up the gene list. This requires giving each gene an unique id
# and record its name and GO (Gene Ontology) feature.

# Identify each new Functional Class (FC) as this will be a new sub-graph in the network
# Load each new FC in to a dictionary

# For each individual FC gather evidence (edges) between each node (gene)

# Identify the end of a FC and end of the file.


# Create a header and footer for the gml file
# Create a sub graph for each FC
# Create the nodes for the graph
# Create the edges

# Close the files
